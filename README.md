## What inspired us to come up with "Eduthene"?
We expect our platform to be serving as the mediator between students and their educational successes in a way that is more modern and appealing to today’s youth, to portray this ideal we made up a word which is a combination of education (EDU) and the name of Athene/Athena (THENE) the Greek goddess of wisdom, knowledge, craft and justice- In a nutshell, we want to promote the motives of gaining Knowledge by engaging, being Crafty with the methods of memorising and doing Justice to the expectations laid out in the future.

## What all features does it have?
Our platform focuses on the constant engagement with subjective and social development thus it has the following features to name a few:
1)	Column where the students get access to various YouTube links through which they can explore interesting theories/experiments and topics and explore their interests widely, visuals also help students to build their concepts gradually,
2)	Column where the students can play/select Lo-Fi background music while they are doing assignments would help them focus as music acts as a stimulus moreover it would block out the uneven noises of the surrounding/house with a steady tune,
3)	Concentration is a factor that is the key towards being on top of given tasks and people often struggle through it due to various reasons (ADD/ADHD/Autism)and our provision of Pomodoro Countdown will reduce the issue as it breaks a big task into chunks to be done within 25mins with a break of 5 mins. Studying in timed intervals makes the concept of burden die down for a bit.
4)	We also have a timer through which the students can solve tests/assignments by constantly timing them, timer also makes it easier for a student to track their productivity throughout the day.
5)	With the Digital Age moving and developing at the speed of light, the students must learn to function in teams and develop a sense of team building, networking and strong command of communication. To develop this we have a section which provides such information specifically about “Internships and Programs”
6)	The website also has links to educational news, reports on admissions/cutoffs and syllabus so that the students using this platform stay on top of things and well informed.
7)	As stated before, we strive to foster a sense of engagement and creativity thus we have a column of book recommendations they can refer to which would in a period broaden imagination and improve the creative quotient,

## Story behind our Official Logo?
Nasir-i-Khusraw quoted “Make a shield from knowledge,for there is no stronger shield against calamities”- and this inspired us to come up with our logo whose base is a shield or a shield of knowledge in this case.
Nelson Mandela once stated that “Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world” – This ever-running quote inspired us to depict the “powerful weapon of education” with a sword and an open book that crowns the shield. 
The sword being held by an octopus tentacle depicts the fact that Athena: The goddess of knowledge, wisdom, craft and justice being a shape shifter as most Greek mythological rulers had the powers to.
